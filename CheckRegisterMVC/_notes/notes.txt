For the sample app, I’d like for you to program a simple check register.  The following features should exist:
·        Create, update and delete a receipt
·        List the receipts entered
·        The form should have the ability to enter an account, date, transaction type, store name, amount and multiple categories
·        You should be able to split the total amount and assign individual amounts to each category
·        Validation to ensure the split amounts equal the total amount of the receipt.
